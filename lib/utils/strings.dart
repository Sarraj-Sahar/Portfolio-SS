String AboutMeText =
    "I graduated last year with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Software Engineering at the South Mediterranean University on a full  excellence scholarship. My interest in mobile app  development was sparked when I joined my first university  club and was introduced to Flutter.\n\nSince then, I have  spent all of my summer internships building mobile apps, and my passion for the field has only grown stronger. I am  always on the lookout for opportunities that will allow me  to further develop my skills and collaborate with highly  motivated individuals.";
